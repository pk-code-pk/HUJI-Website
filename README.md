# HUJI-Website



This is a website I designed for the Harvard Undergraduate Japan Initative using HTML, CSS, and JS. 
Some of the assets are too large to include in the repository, but they will be displayed on the deployed website. 
The main highlight of this site is the landing page which utilizes a video background for a sleek, modern look.
